Main features: Minimal : Downloads entire datasets with just 1 line of code. Compatible : Loads data as numpy arrays or pandas dataframes which can be easily used with the majority of Machine Learning frameworks. Transparent : By default stores the data in your current project so you can easily inspect it. Memory Efficient : When a dataset doesn't fit in memory it will return metadata instead you can iteratively load it. Integrates with Kaggle : Supports loading datasets directly from Kaggle in a variety of formats. Getting Started \u00b6 In dataget you just have to do two things: Select a dataset from the data module. Use the get to download the data to disk and load it into memory. import dataget as dg X_train , y_train , X_test , y_test = dg . data . vision . mnist () . get () This examples downloads the MNIST to ./data/vision_mnist and loads it as numpy arrays. Kaggle \u00b6 Kaggle promotes the use of csv files and dataget loves it! You can download any dataset from the platform and have immediate access to the data on your local machine: import dataget as dg df_train , df_test = dg . data . kaggle ( \"cristiangarcia/pointcloudmnist2d\" ) . get ( files = [ \"train.csv\" , \"test.csv\" ] ) In the future we want to expand Kaggle support in the following ways: Be able to load any file that numpy or pandas can read. Have generic support for other types of datasets like images, audio, video, etc. e.g dg.data.kaggle(..., type=\"vision\").get(...) Installation \u00b6 dataget is avaiable at pypi so you can use your favorite package manager install to it: pip \u00b6 pip install dataget pipenv \u00b6 pipenv install pytest poetry \u00b6 poetry add dataget","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#dataget","text":"Dataget is an easy to use, framework-agnostic, dataset library that gives you quick access to a collection of Machine Learning datasets through a simple API.
