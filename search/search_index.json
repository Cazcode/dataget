Minimal : Downloads entire datasets with just 1 line of code. Compatible : Loads data as Pandas Dataframes which can be easily used with the majority of Machine Learning frameworks. Efficient : Loads data as Pandas Dataframes which can be easily used with the majority of Machine Learning frameworks. Transparent : By default stores data in your current project so you can easily inspect it. Kaggle Integration : Supports loading Kaggle Datasets in a variety of formats. Getting Started In dataget you just have to use two functions: data to specify source of the data. get to download the dataset to disk and load it into memory. import dataget as dg df_train , df_test = dg . data ( \"mnist\" ) . get () This examples downloads the MNIST to ./data/mnist and loads it as pandas dataframes.
